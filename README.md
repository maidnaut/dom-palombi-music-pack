# Balatro Dom Palombi Mod

A mod made using Dom Palombi's remix suite for Balatro, including the new shop theme!

All credit goes to Dom and Luis Clement, all I did was adjust the lengths of the songs for the game and looped them appropriately.

## Installation

Installation **requires** [SteamModded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods). You could manually install by replacing the music in resource/sounds/, but looping won't work correctly because the audio won't be properly registered with love2d.

After installing SteamModded, you can either ``git clone https://github.com/maidnaut/don-palombi-music-pack.git`` into your mods folder, or you can place it there manually.
